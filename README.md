# Introduction

This repository contains the code and analysis pipeline for a project entitled  "The association between a genetic risk score and autistic-like traits" which was done as part of [KI Summer School in Medical Research](https://education.ki.se/ki-summer-school-in-medical-research). Together with my supervisor, Dr [Yi Lu](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=OucCRnoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) i investigated how a genetic risk scores relates to the three core symptoms in autism-spectrum disorder.
