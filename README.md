# About the project

This repository contains the code and analysis pipeline for a project entitled  "The association between a genetic risk score and autistic-like traits" which was done as part of [KI Summer School in Medical Research](https://education.ki.se/ki-summer-school-in-medical-research). Together with my supervisor, Dr [Yi Lu](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=OucCRnoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), we investigated how a genetic risk scores relates to the three core symptoms in autism-spectrum disorder(ASD).


## Autistic like traits

One meta-analysis estimate the heritability of ASD to be between 73-91%. [1](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.kib.ki.se/doi/full/10.1111/jcpp.12499), which does indicate that genetic effects have relatively large role to play. ASD is often conceptualized as a trio of three core symptoms; 1issues with social reciprocity, repetitive and stereotypical behaviour or interests, and impairments in verbal and nonverbal communication.

We wanted to investigate if genetic factors were more associated to one of these symptoms. To do this, we calculated a genetic risk score, a measure of the total genetic liability for all the individuals in a sample of twins from the Swedish Twin Registry.
